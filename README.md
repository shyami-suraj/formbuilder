To set up the project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies
First, you need to install the necessary packages. Run the following command in your terminal:


npm install

Start the Mock Server
After installing the dependencies, you can start the mock server using json-server. This will allow you to simulate a backend API. Run the following command:

json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
This command will watch the db.json file for changes and serve it on port 3000.

Run the Project
Finally, to start the project, use the following command:
npm run dev


This will start your development server, and you can view your application in the browser.
